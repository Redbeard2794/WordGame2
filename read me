log out and log back in as the user that was just created:
	quit
	mysql -u wordgame2dev -p wordGameDB
	enter the password: wordgame2

create the words table:
	create table allWords
	(
	id int not null auto_increment,
	word varchar(40) not null,
	primary key(id)
	);

	(
	time double(8,3) not null,
	name varchar(40) not null,
	id int not null auto_increment,
	primary key(id)
	);
